# Project-2
This is my second ever own project where I will build a stockmarket data analysis using csv files and tkinter.

The first thing that happens when you open the program is that a tkinter window opens up with 3 buttons.
Sign in, sign up or exit, everything gets saved using pickle so the program will remember you username and password the next time you enter the program. When you are logged in you go to a new tkniter window that shows stockmarket data analysis with a line graph and here you can inspect bitcoin, gold, omx30, silver and usd market using buttons.
There is also a exit button there if you want to do that.
